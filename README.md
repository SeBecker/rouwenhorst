This repository a simple method for the approximating a highly persistent AR(1) process via a discrete state space Markov chain as firstly proposed by Rouwenhorst 1995.

As shown in

Karen A. Kopecky and Richard M.H. Suen. (2010). [Finite state Markov-chain approximations to highly persistent processes.
](https://www.jstor.org/stable/43616962#metadata_info_tab_contents) *Revie of Economic Dynamics*, Vol.13, No.3, 701-714.


the main advantage of the method is that it matches the condoctional and unconditional mean and variance as well as the first order autocorrelation of the underlying approximated process and that it outperformes other common methods for approcimating AR(1) in terms of acuracy.
